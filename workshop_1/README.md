1. Write a program to generate a list of all prime numbers less than 20.
  Before starting it is important to note what a prime number is.
    1. A prime number has to be a positive integer
  2. Divisible by exactly 2 integers (1 and itself)
  3. 1 is not a prime number


2. Let’s play “Guess The Number Game”.
  Generate random integer in range (0,20) and then try to guess it with console input.
  1. If “” or “exit” entered, program will exit
  2. If no digital was entered, show appropriate message and wait for new input
  3. If entered number greater than generated one, show appropriate message
  4. If entered number lower than generated one, show appropriate message


3. Export list of 3 most common words in Python Zen,
 where each item of list looks like (‘word’, frequency)
